This plugin prevents players from curing zombie villagers, by stopping the curing process before it can begin. It sends a message to the server console, OP players in-game, and the DiscordSRV Staff-Chat channel if you are using that plugin.

The message says who tried to, and where they tried to cure a zombie villager.
